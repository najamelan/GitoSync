#
# The root of the configuration determines profiles:
# This is the default profile, you should put this in your own files as well.
# Next you can have sections that have differently named profiles, which means you can call gitomate
# to temporarily change things. Eg. Have a profile that sets permissions to allow phpMyAdmin or wordpress updates.
#
# You can invoke a profile as `gitomate sycn --profile=example` which is included with the software.
# If the profile option is ommitted, profile default will be run. All profiles will always inherit from default.

# @param String|Array<String> The directories where gitomate configuration is going to be read from.
#                             You can also specify files instead of directories.
#
# For directories, the files inside need to have extension .yml and not be dotfiles (begin with a dot)
# in order to be taken into account.
#
# If you specify files directly, this restriction is disregarded.
#
# <installDir>/conf will always be read first.

default:

  # You can inherit from another profile. 'default' is the root profile. It will always be the first in the inheritance
  # chain and will inherit from nothing.
  #
  # Technically, all configuration files are parsed, with later values overriding earlier ones. Next profile
  # inheritance is looked at. If you have chosen a profile other than default, it's inherit property is checked.
  # If it is empty, it inherits just from default.
  #
  # If it points to another profile, then that profile is resolved, after which your profile will override values
  # from the super profile.
  #
  # Inheriting from an unexisting profile or creating circular dependencies will make the software bail out.
  #
  # Different profiles will only inherit from default unless you specify inherit as shown here. Multiple inheritance is
  # not supported.

  # inherit: otherProfile

  # Values in this key will always be written from the default profile. They cannot be overridden in a different profile.
  # The install operation will also ignore the profile flag on the command line.
