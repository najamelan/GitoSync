    # feedback goes to the logFile specified in this section

    STDERR:

      enabled : true

    # Beware of enabling feedback to STDOUT, as the git protocol uses STDOUT. That means that things will break
    # with not so obvious error messages if this is used in git hooks and gitolite triggers.
    #
    STDOUT:

      enabled : false
      logLevel: :WARN


# These are defaults for every repository. In the repos section, if you ommit these keys, these defaults
# will be used. You can override these defaults in conf.d
#
repo:

  branch   : master
  parentDir: /var/www
  gituser  : gitcontent


# The list of repositories that gitomate manages. Must be an array. Defaults to an empty array.
#
repos   : []


# The different gitusers that gitomate interacts with. Must be an array. You could have different ones
# for example if you want to use etckeeper with gitolite to manage your server configuration
# but want a different gitolite user which does not have root privileges for your user content
# (eg. websites)
#
gitusers:

  - gitetc
  - gitcontent
