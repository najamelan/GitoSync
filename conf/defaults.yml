# DO NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THIS FILE. THEY WILL BE OVERWRITTEN BY UPDATES.
#
# use conf.d/yourconf.yml
# configuration files in conf.d will be loaded in alphabetical order with later files
# overriding options set in earlier files. Note that hashes will be merged, but that
# arrays (eg. 'gitusers' or 'repos') will be overwritten.
#

# These are defaults for every repository. In the repos section, if you ommit these keys, these defaults
# will be used. You can override these defaults in conf.d
#
repo:

  branch   : master
  parentDir: /var/www
  gituser  : gitcontent

# The list of repositories that gitomate manages. Defaults to an empty array.
#
repos   : []

# The different gitusers that gitomate interacts with. You could have different ones
# for example if you want to use etckeeper with gitolite to manage your server configuration
# but want a different gitolite user which does not have root privileges for your user content
# (eg. websites)
#
gitusers:

  - gitetc
  - gitcontent
